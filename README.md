# toDoList

## Description

This project is a simple to-do list which currently has basic features. The basic featues are allowing the user to create different projects and to add tasks into each project. This to-do list uses local storage so upon refreshing/closing the page the user tasks/projects will remain on their respective computer. I struggled to implement proper modules. All the javascript is contained within a single file which is less than ideal. My use of a render function and clear element functon were proper solutions to seperating core logic from UI logic.
